= Build and Test a RESTful Controller with Spring Boot

This API, explained below lets us compute squares and roots of doubles.
It serves as the example content for our RESTFUL demo.

To square (n^2) a number:

include::{snippets}/square/http-request.adoc[]

That gives us the number that is the square of it's input. Simple? Yes.

include::{snippets}/square/http-response.adoc[]

To GET a the ROOT (Math.sqrt(n)) of a number:

include::{snippets}/root/http-request.adoc[]

This gives us the number that is the root of it's input. Presto!

include::{snippets}/root/http-response.adoc[]

This concludes this tutorial on Documenting RESTful Controller implementation.
