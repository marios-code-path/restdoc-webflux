= Build and Test a RESTful Controller with Spring Boot

This API, explained below lets us receive Strings.
It serves as the example content for our RESTFUL demo.

operation::ok[]

That gives us the String "OK". Simple? Yes.

To GET an "Hello $NAME" String:

operation::hello[]

This concludes this tutorial on RESTful Controller implementation.
